LibYAML-DOM

About
-----
This library is a wrapper for the streaming parser and emitter APIs
for LibYAML providing a replacement DOM style API. It is able to
generate a document graph from scratch or parse a YAML document
into a document graph for editing. Once the document is complete,
it can be emitted through a single function call.

The native LibYAML DOM style API seems to require the user to keep
track of the index of each non-root node they wish to lookup.
